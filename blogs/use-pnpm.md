# Use PNPM instead of NPM

If you're a Node.js developer, you're probably familiar with package managers like **NPM** and **Yarn**. However, there's another package manager called **PNPM** that offers even greater efficiency and speed. PNPM is based on Yarn, but it takes performance to the next level. In this post, we'll explore the advantages of using PNPM over NPM or Yarn and why it's worth considering for your projects.

## The Problem

Both NPM and Yarn have their own advantages, but they share one common drawback: every time you run a command, they need to download the entire package index from the internet. This process creates large amounts of redundant data, leading to bloated node_modules folders and consuming precious disk space. This can be especially problematic when dealing with large repositories that have multiple packages.

## The Solution

PNPM, which stands for Performant-Node-Package-Manager, addresses this problem efficiently. When you install a package using PNPM, it downloads the package from the internet and stores it in a global storage cache. The next time you need the same package for another project, PNPM simply creates a [symlink](what-is-symlink.md) to the globally cached package instead of downloading it again. This not only improves installation speed but also significantly reduces storage usage by reducing folder sizes.

Additionally, PNPM offers excellent support for monorepo workspaces. It seamlessly manages multiple packages within a single repository, making it an ideal choice for projects with this structure.

## Advantages of PNPM

1. **Enhanced Security**: Like Yarn, PNPM includes a file with checksums for all installed packages. This ensures that the integrity of each package is verified before executing its code, adding an extra layer of security.

2. **Offline Mode**: PNPM maintains a local registry mirror where it saves all downloaded package tarballs. When a package is available locally, PNPM avoids making unnecessary HTTP requests. With the `--offline` parameter, you can completely prohibit HTTP requests, making it possible to work offline with ease.

3. **Lightning-Fast Performance**: PNPM not only surpasses NPM in terms of speed but also outperforms Yarn, even when comparing both cold and hot cache scenarios. PNPM achieves this by efficiently linking files from the global store, rather than copying them from cache like Yarn does.

4. **Monorepo Support**: While NPM was designed for individual projects, PNPM provides built-in support for managing multiple packages within a repository. This makes it ideal for monorepos, allowing you to efficiently handle dependencies across various projects.

5. **Space Efficiency**: PNPM eliminates the need to repeatedly download the same packages, resulting in reduced clutter and optimized storage usage. By linking files from the global store instead of duplicating them, PNPM saves space and reduces disk usage.

6. **Easy Transition**: PNPM's command structure is identical to NPM, meaning there's no learning curve when switching. You can seamlessly incorporate PNPM into your existing workflow without any hassle.

## Conclusion

PNPM offers undeniable advantages over traditional package managers like NPM and Yarn. With its enhanced security, offline mode, exceptional speed, support for monorepos, efficient storage usage, and ease of use, PNPM provides a more efficient package management solution for Node.js projects.

If you're tired of bloated node_modules folders and sluggish installations, consider making the switch to PNPM. Its ability to handle multiple packages within a repository and its efficient space management make it a superior choice for developers seeking optimal performance and productivity.
